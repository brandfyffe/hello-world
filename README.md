Beginning the journey

I'm an overworked, underpaid educator who has too many degrees that make me overqualified for any job I might actually want to do. My life goal is to obtain a remote position and go live in Belize. There aren't many goals I don't achieve. ;)
I am fairly new to coding and whatnot, but I learn fast and my determination is unparalleled. I am ready to get a move on. #iamasponge
